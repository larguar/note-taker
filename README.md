## User Story
```
As a user
I want to be able to write and save notes, as well as delete notes I've written before
So that I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```


## Functionality
```
WHEN a user visits the main path
THEN they are greeted with an entry page

WHEN the user clicks the Get Started button
THEN they are taken to the notes page where they can see all of their previous notes in the sidebar

WHEN the user clicks on any note in the sidebar
THEN the full note displays for them

WHEN the user enters a title and text for a new note
THEN a save button appears

WHEN the user clicks the save button
THEN the note is added to the sidebar and the JSON file with all notes
